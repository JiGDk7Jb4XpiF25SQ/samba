UPGRADING
=========


NEW FEATURES/CHANGES
====================


net ads setspn
---------------

There is a new 'net ads setspn' sub command for managing Windows SPN(s)
on the AD. This command aims to give the basic functionaility that is
provided on windows by 'setspn.exe' e.g. ability to add, delete and list
Windows SPN(s) stored in a Windows AD Computer object.

The format of the command is:

net ads setspn list [machine]
net ads setspn [add | delete ] SPN [machine]

'machine' is the name of the computer account on the AD that is to be managed.
If 'machine' is not specified the name of the 'client' running the command
is used instead.

The format of a Windows SPN is
  'serviceclass/host:port/servicename' (servicename and port are optional)

serviceclass/host is generally sufficient to specify a host based service.

net ads keytab changes
----------------------
net ads keytab add no longer attempts to convert the passed serviceclass
(e.g. nfs, html etc.) into a Windows SPN which is added to the Windows AD
computer object. By default just the keytab file is modified.

A new keytab subcommand 'add_update_ads' has been added to preserve the
legacy behaviour. However the new 'net ads setspn add' subcommand should
really be used instead.

net ads keytab create no longer tries to generate SPN(s) from existing
entries in a keytab file. If it is required to add Windows SPN(s) then
'net ads setspn add' should be used instead.

Local authorization plugin for MIT Kerberos
-------------------------------------------

This plugin controls the relationship between Kerberos principals and AD
accounts through winbind. The module receives the Kerberos principal and the
local account name as inputs and can then check if they match. This can resolve
issues with canonicalized names returned by Kerberos within AD. If the user
tries to log in as 'alice', but the samAccountName is set to ALICE (uppercase),
Kerberos would return ALICE as the username. Kerberos would not be able to map
'alice' to 'ALICE' in this case and auth would fail.  With this plugin account
names can be correctly mapped. This only applies to GSSAPI authentication,
not for the geting the initial ticket granting ticket.

REMOVED FEATURES
================



smb.conf changes
================

As the most popular Samba install platforms (Linux and FreeBSD) both
support extended attributes by default, the parameters "map readonly",
"store dos attributes" and "ea support" have had their defaults changed
to allow better Windows fileserver compatibility in a default install.

  Parameter Name                     Description             Default
  --------------                     -----------             -------
  map readonly                       Default changed              no
  store dos attributes               Default changed             yes
  ea support                         Default changed             yes

VFS interface changes
=====================

The VFS ABI interface version has changed to 39. Function changes
are:

SMB_VFS_FSYNC: Removed: Only async versions are used.
SMB_VFS_READ: Removed: Only PREAD or async versions are used.
SMB_VFS_WRITE: Removed: Only PWRITE or async versions are used.
SMB_VFS_CHMOD_ACL: Removed: Only CHMOD is used.
SMB_VFS_FCHMOD_ACL: Removed: Only FCHMOD is used.

Any external VFS modules will need to be updated to match these
changes in order to work with 4.9.x.
